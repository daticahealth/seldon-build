In the first article in this series, I outlined <a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/">six trends for 2018</a> I predict we’ll see as the government, individuals, and private sector demand change this year. The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay practices. Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><p>What do you do when you get so frustrated with inefficiency and intermediaries in a transaction? If you’re like most consumers today, you’ll find a way to go directly to the supplier — meaning anybody producing a product or service that is of value to customers. There are huge technology leaps being made that have eliminated logistical challenges and enabled suppliers to have new or improved direct access to customers; as you can see below, it’s also created many opportunities for new, very large businesses.</p> <p>Here’s a short list of direct-to-supplier examples:</p> <ul> <li>Alibaba allows you to order directly from factories in China. It eliminates retailers. This is typically used for commercial merchandise and equipment. Try it. It’s incredible what you can customize for an order of 1 and have directly shipped to you.</li> <li>Etsy connects small, niche makers to sell directly to customers. It eliminates retailers and opens up huge geographies for makers. Etsy has gotten a lot of bad press lately but that doesn’t change the underlying premise.</li> <li>Patreon enables creators to be sponsored by fans, or patrons, through subscriptions. It provides artists more freedom to pursue their craft with direct support from fans.</li> <li>Stratechery is a subscription technology analysis publication. It eliminates publishers. It’s one person, Ben Thompson, that has built a personal brand outside of traditional publishing channels. There are many such publications but Stratechery is a personal favorite.</li> <li>The Athletic is a subscription local sports publication. It eliminates traditional paper press. It enables local sports writers to provide deeper insight into players and teams through long-form publishing that doesn’t fit well with where traditional newspapers have evolved.</li> <li>Netflix sells on-demand video content directly to consumers. It reduces the demand for cable bundles and, in the process, traditional advertisers. Now, with public market funding, Netflix is building the largest content catalog in the world and selling access to it directly to consumers.</li> </ul> <h2 id=healthcare-transactions-are-frustrating-for-consumers-and-providers>Healthcare transactions are frustrating for consumers and providers</h2> <p>If you were to poll people on the most frustrating experiences they’ve had with transactions, I’d wager that healthcare ranks number one. The commercial payor process in healthcare is broken to the core, mostly by design, to create friction that intentionally minimizes payment to providers and reduces the liability of payors. The process sucks for both sides.</p> <p>Consumers typically have insurance through employers, reducing or eliminating choice. Payors then have networks of approved providers, thereby dictating which providers those consumers are allowed to see, again reducing choice. Then, when consumers go to their provider to get care it’s nearly impossible to have an accurate idea of their responsibility before a service is provided; they only find out much later how much the service cost, how much the payors haggled the price down, what the payor covered, and what amount is left for the individual to pay.</p> <p>Believe it or not, the provider side is worse. Payors are heavy handed — to put it mildly — with providers in negotiating payment rates. For example, commercial payors pay providers vastly different rates based on the supply and demand for different specialties in different geographic areas. Payors also drag their feet and take anywhere from 60 days to 6 months after applications are submitted to approve new fully-licensed physicians and add them to their networks. Then, providers submit claims and those claims are either rejected (based on real or not even real mistakes in claim submission and documentation) or paid within some period of time (usually 30 to 90 days). Providers can then dispute rejected claims. This is a lot of work and providers spend lots of money to increase collections and speed the time to collections; simplistically this is “revenue cycle management” and is a multibillion-dollar industry in its own right in healthcare.</p> <p>When something goes wrong, consumers often blame providers; read provider reviews online and you’ll see many of them are complaints about payment. It’s a lot easier to blame the provider, with a face in front of you, vs the payor with it’s oftentimes outsourced call center service options.</p> <h2 id=the-commercial-insurance-model-of-care-insulates-both-providers-and-patients>The commercial insurance model of care insulates both providers and patients</h2> <p>One of the major hurdles in applying free market principles to healthcare in the United States is that, as I laid out above, the parties involved in the healthcare services transaction — the provider and the patient — are insulated from the financial transaction. I’m talking about the commercial insurance model of care that dominates our health system today. In this model, while there is typically some financial exchange with patients paying a deductible and, at times, some amount of patient responsibility at or before care is provided, oftentimes the bulk of payment for healthcare services is done separately, insulating providers and patients. This insulation is true even of providers in small private practices and is especially true for employed physicians who typically track what are called relative value units (RVUs), not collections, that determine their salaries; RVUs are a topic unto themselves and beyond the scope of this post.</p> <h2 id=are-cash-pay-medical-practices-the-solution>Are cash-pay medical practices the solution?</h2> <p>What’s the reaction to this? Cut out the payors. This is what cash-pay medical practices are all about. Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors. This is providers and consumer reacting to the frustration and overhead of working with payors. The desirable outcomes are similar for both providers and patients — longer appointments, more timely access to providers (off hours is usually included), and real accountability.</p> <p>Cash-pay medicine has seen a tremendous growth in popularity and will continue to grow as the traditional commercial insurance model of healthcare continues to get worse. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/01/30/1-in-10-doctor-practices-flee-medicare-to-concierge-medicine/#4819d6514568">Survey data consistently shows</a> that a high number of providers are interested in switching to concierge medicine. Sadly, the poster children for building networks and scaling cash-pay medicine have not fared well — <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/qliance-closes-after-10-year-effort-at-new-approach-to-basic-medical-care/">QLiance</a> and <a href="https://lasvegasweekly.com/intersection/2017/jan/11/turntable-healths-closure-leaves-downtown-patients/">Turntable Health</a> have struggled and had to shut down. <a href="https://www.onemedical.com">One Medical</a> has grown more slowly than expected and has had to raise almost $250M in the process. Some, like <a href="https://medlion.com">MedLion</a>, are trying to sell subscription medicine, mainly virtual care, through employers.</p> <p>The lessons from these companies is not that cash-pay medicine doesn’t work (<a href="https://stateofreform.com/news/industry/healthcare-providers/2015/01/qliance-study-shows-monthly-fee-primary-care-model-saves-20-percent-claims/">here’s data</a> showing saving from cash pay), it’s that scaling a network of cash-pay medical practices is very hard in today’s healthcare environment. Cash-pay practices that hold old on and remain outside the system will be smaller, more independent practices. That’s the biggest obstacle to cash-pay medicine — converting small practices is hard and perceived as very risky. But, those smaller, independent cash-pay practices are starting to share their stories and insights through online forums. These online forums, like Facebook groups, are reducing the barriers for providers to convert practices to cash pay. I personally know multiple physicians who are planning to convert to cash-pay practices in 2018 and their main source of information is Facebook.</p> <p>At the same time, consumers/patients are more open to cash-pay practices. As healthcare delivery and traditional, claims-based payment have become more convoluted, consumers have become more willing to pay directly for higher-level access to their providers. I don’t think a large portion of the public is ready to spend $150-$200/mo. for concierge medicine but I do think a decent proportion is willing to pay $40-70/mo.</p> <p>As more providers leave traditional payor based healthcare to open cash-based practices, more consumers are willing to sign up. And, as that happens, we are seeing more digital health technologies built to help cash-based practices — <a href="https://hint.com">Hint Health</a> manages the back office, <a href="https://atlas.md">Atlas.MD</a> is a subscription-based practice EHR, and <a href="https://sprucehealth.com">Spruce Health</a> connects providers directly to patients and allows practices to easily offer new, differentiated services to patients. This is the cycle that will push more cash-pay medicine into healthcare.</p> <p>Cash-pay medicine is not for every provider and not for every consumer. But, it does fit well with a growing number of independent practices that want to remain viable and can’t survive against larger provider networks and health systems. I predict 2018 will be the year that cash pay, subscription medicine becomes a real option for both providers and patients.</p> <p>Follow the healthcare trends series by subscribing to blog updates on the right.

The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html">HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool</a>.</p> <p>Because entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However, a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent <a href="https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/">penalties of GDPR</a> coming in May of 2018.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><h2 id=hipaa-security-is-still-a-problem>HIPAA Security is still a problem</h2> <p>One thing is certain: healthcare <a href="https://datica.com/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/">still has a security problem</a>. The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches.</p> <p><img src="//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg" alt="2017 Data Breaches by Type"/></p> <p>One of the largest, which occurred at Airway Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and reported the breach to HHS in June.</p> <p>According to <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier">a story about the Airway Oxygen breach</a> in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.</p> <p>The story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking.</p> <h2 id=many-types-of-entities-are-at-risk-not-only-healthcare-providers>Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers</h2> <p>Another interesting thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies, and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches as well.</p> <p>Late in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html">MongoDB databases fell victim to ransomware</a> attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice) that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special hacking tool.”</p> <p>MongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software, but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September 2017, as many as 26,000 <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find">databases were hijacked and held for ransom</a>. Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in the attacks, along with other entities.</p> <h2 id=lessons-from-others-mistakes>Lessons from others’ mistakes</h2> <p>On December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI) was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals.</p> <p>The FBI found that the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server. As many as 2.2 million people were affected.</p> <p>The settlement was for 21CO to pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein &amp; Lehr LLP, the results of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into <a href="https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement">what all healthcare entities should be doing</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI); (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and, (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate without having written business associate agreement in place.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The CAP that 21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements, among several other steps.</p> <p>Saul Ewing Arnstein &amp; Lehr offer advice to other business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing,</p> <blockquote> <p>As we begin 2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance and make timely adjustments as appropriate.”</p> </blockquote> <p>As we move through 2018 and toward May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not only with HIPAA, but also <a href="https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/">with GDPR</a>. After all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that amount in GDPR fines.</p> <p>Let Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for your digital health application with our HITRUST-certified healthcare platform.
