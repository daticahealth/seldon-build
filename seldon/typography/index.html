The problem is that things are really hard and messy right now in healthcare.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><blockquote> <p>½ of all digital health startups fail within their first two years!”</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=defining-success-and-failure-in-digital-health>Defining success and failure in digital health</h2> <p>So to define success we kind of look at it as having a genuine impact with your business on the market. If you are, then the ideas that you have in terms of improving patient satisfaction, or curing cancer, for example, may let you improve patient outcomes.</p> <p>If you aren’t hitting those things then the definition of failure is more or less you running out of money, or your business not getting funding to get your product off the ground. But more importantly, your innovation is not having a genuine impact on the lives of patients.</p> <p><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5gqdPRZFwIIoimyECsEASU/471d116fe14cb4a6460765a3c1288205/blog-sxsw-18-illustration.png" alt=blog-sxsw-18-illustration /></p> <h2 id=why-half-of-digital-health-startups-will-fail>Why half of digital health startups will fail</h2> <p>It simply comes down to the fact that healthcare is a very unique beast. There are challenges within it that you will not find in any other industry. And so it’s understanding those challenges and those blockers that can help give you a shortcut to success.</p> <p>To follow, are four challenges that are specific to healthcare.</p> <h3 id=incentives>Incentives</h3> <p>The payor is the insurance company and often they are the ones that dictate which sort of innovations are the ones that are going to be deployed within health systems. And that’s because there is a complex and convoluted way in which the payers actually pay for services and technology. Historically, healthcare has been what’s called pay-for-service or fee-for-service and that means that essentially when a practitioner does a job that practitioner can file via a code somewhere and get paid for that.</p> <p>Healthcare is transitioning now to what’s called fee-for-value or value-based care and this is through programs like MIPS, MACRO, etc. Essentially, what value-based care means is that there are multiple parties now that are joined to try to make the patient better, and the success over a finite timeline determines if the whole chain gets paid.</p> <p>So because of that, even if you have a really great idea, by far the most common blocker to that idea actually being used by the market is not understanding exactly who’s going to be paying for it and how that will fit into this system.</p> <h3 id=healthcare-is-local>Healthcare is local</h3> <p>This means that there is not as much competition as you would expect or that we see in other industries. Because of this, there’s not as much pressure as you might expect in another industry and this lack of competition, this lack of pressure, means that the priorities set by the administrators at these hospitals are different.</p> <h3 id=healthcare-deals-with-peoples-lives>Healthcare deals with people’s lives</h3> <p>The impact of your technology or idea is really a situation of life or death. But even underneath that, there’s a subtext which is that we’re also dealing with the data that relates to patients lives. We have PHI and we have human genome sequencing data as examples. The data is very different and the stakes with the data are high. On the black market, credit card data right now goes for about $35. A patient record goes for about $260. So the overall value of your PHI records on the dark web is much higher. Because the stakes are so high, it means that conservatism is way higher than you would ever expect.</p> <blockquote> <p>On the black market, credit card data right now goes for about $35. A patient record goes for about $260.”</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=more-data-means-more-complexity>More data means more complexity</h3> <p>The amount of healthcare data that is stored has exploded in recent years and doctors, hospital, CIOs, and even EHR vendors don’t really know what to do with all that data. Nobody’s really found a way yet how to fit it in and make it useful and the fact that it just keeps growing makes that challenge even more complex.</p> <p>But there are also more complex things beyond just the data. For example, take a look at the most recent versions of ICD. ICD-9 had roughly 17,000 codes, ICD-10 increased that by a factor of 10, and then, with the semantic structure changes of ICD-11, there are additional combinations or permutations. Now doctors, nurses, CEOs, etc. have to manage more than 1 million permutations of options to codify a patient.</p> <p>All of that means it’s just getting harder for <a href="https://datica.com/dhsf/">digital health to succeed</a> every single year.</p> <h2 id=things-you-need-to-know-to-win-at-the-digital-health-game>Things you need to know to win at the digital health game</h2> <ul> <li>There really isn’t a concept of scale. One of the hardest points to communicate to brand-new digital health startups is that there is no real-time API. You cannot plug into an API and get access to all patients or to all installations of Epic. Every single installation or integration of your product at a hospital is reinventing the wheel. Every time it’s a VPN, point-to-point connection it uses 1980s protocols called HL7. Healthcare is one of the least interoperable industries in the country and this is why.</li> <li>The buyer is not the user or the one who will benefit. And this goes back to the payment structure we talked about above. As soon as you can understand where you fit in the payment structure, your business has a chance.</li> <li>The technology is really old on purpose. If you’re a technologist, it will shock and upset you to know that most hospitals are using an EHR that works in IE8 compatibility mode, and uses ActiveX directory or ActiveX tooling. Understanding how your new innovation can fit into that existing, old technology paradigm is really important. Also, a hospital CIOs priority is to manage their four-to-five-hundred Windows VMs sitting in their data center much more than it is to buy a singular app and try to fit it into their existing workflows.</li> </ul> <p>If you take the time to really understand the market, you’ll have much better success at getting your foot inside your buyer’s door.</p> <h2 id=quick-tips-for-success>4 quick tips for success</h2> <ol> <li>Fit into the existing world that is healthcare. Digital health vendors need to have enough capitalization to last through pilots and through the period of trying to sell into hospitals.</li> <li>Stick with a B2B model. A B2C model is really hard to make work in healthcare. And that’s because people generally aren’t willing to pay for apps. The exception to this is the wearable market which is seeing some success. To make an impact, you need to think of your market as payers, providers, pharma or life sciences — not patients.</li> <li>Develop clinical evidence and demonstrate outcomes. Demonstrate the efficacy of your digital health product to break through the noise that your buyer — a CIO, CMIO, CISO, CTO, or CNO — faces.</li> <li>Gain trust by being knowledgeable. You must have a deep understanding of compliance (things like <a href="https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA</a>, SOC2, ISO, GXP, and <a href="https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/">HITRUST</a>, interoperability, <a href="https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/">infrastructure</a>, frameworks, etc. in order for your buyer to trust you enough to do business with you.</li> </ol> <p>Follow this guidance and you’ll be able to walk into your buyer’s office on day one with confidence that you have a strategy to be one of the ones who succeed.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <div class="group drop"> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--gray-dark"> <p class=blog-date>March 16, 2018</p> <h1 class=headline-2>Overview of the Current Administration's Approach to HIT</h1> </div> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--white"> <article class=content-dynamic> <div class=lead><p>Two recent talks have shed light on what people in the healthcare information technology sector might expect from the current administration. The first was a speech by Alex Azar at the Federation of American Hospitals recent meeting about value-based care, and the second, given by Seema Verna at HIMSS18, emphasized the need for interoperability among EHRs. Together, these talks make it clear that the current administration wants to give consumers access to their health data. But, how will this happen?</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <h2 id=alex-azar-promotes-value-based-care-to-fah>Alex Azar promotes value-based care to FAH</h2> <p>The first, given by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to the Federation of American Hospitals on March 5, offered a four-point plan to move to a value-based care system faster. He noted that even taking recent advances in areas such as personalized medicine and cell therapies, the US healthcare system doesn’t deliver results to match costs.</p> <p>His four points included:</p> <ol> <li>Patients, rather than providers, should have ownership of health records.</li> <li>Costs should be transparent.</li> <li>Medicare and Medicaid will be used to drive change in the industry.</li> <li>Regulations that slow progress toward value-based care will be reduced.</li> </ol> <h2 id=seema-verma-announces-initiative-at-himss18>Seema Verma announces initiative at HIMSS18</h2> <p>The second, given the following day, March 6, by the current Administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), Seema Verma at Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society’s 2018 meeting (HIMSS18), emphasized the need for interoperability among electronic health record (EHR) systems.</p> <p>Verma announced a new initiative related to Azar’s first point. It is called the MyHealthEData initiative, and it is designed to give individuals access to their own health records. The announcement about MyHealthEData was published on the CMS website during Verma’s speech.</p> <p>“MyHealthEData will help twork to make clear that patients deserve to not only electronically receive a copy of their entire health record, but also be able to share their data with whomever they want, making the patient the center of the healthcare system,” read <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-items/2018-03-06.html">the announcement.</a></p> <h2 id=the-free-flow-of-information>The free flow of information</h2> <p>At least two factors are likely to inhibit the MyHealthEData initiative: the lack of interoperability among EHRs and the practice of data blocking. Verma addressed both in her HIMSS18 remarks.</p> <p>One way CMS plans to address the barriers to the free flow of information is by overhauling the Meaningful Use program. “Our new direction will not only reduce time and costs, but will also be laser focused on increased interoperability and giving patients access to their data across all of our programs,” <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/cms-shares-plans-to-enable-interoperability-value-based-care">Verma said in her speech.</a><br/> Additionally, data-blocking will be met with “a more aggressive stance” from CMS. “It is not acceptable to limit patient records or to prevent them and their doctor from seeing their complete history outside of a particular healthcare system,” Verma said.</p> <h2 id=what-does-it-all-mean>What does it all mean?</h2> <p>Taken together, these two speeches make it clear that the current administration wants to make sure consumers have access to their own healthcare records. However, that sentiment begs the question: What will consumers do with that information?</p> <p>“There is an entire level here involving not just data and information, but how the purchasers, payers, providers, and consumers of healthcare interact, and might interact going into the future – including with regard to sharing data and information among themselves to make business decisions affecting healthcare consumers,” says Mark Hagland of Healthcare Informatics in an <a href="https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/blogs/mark-hagland/payment/cms-makes-big-splash-verma-s-speech-what-does-it-really-mean?page=3">article analyzing the potential impact of the two speeches.</a></p> <p>Developers and programmers may play an important role in how consumers use their information. Apps that help patients understand and use their health data are likely to play a critical role, as are apps that help to transmit and streamline data.</p> <p>Verma said that patients will receive copies of their EHRs electronically, and that the process will happen through application programming interfaces, or APIs. “CMS believes the future of healthcare depends on the development of open APIs,” said Verma, adding that CMS will function as a convener of APIs across the digital system.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <div class="row section-article"> <div class="columns text-center"> <a href="#top" class="">Back to top <i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/public/js/svg-injector.js"></script> <script>
