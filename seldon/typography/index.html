Datica was an early adopter of Docker containers and, in fact, the Datica Platform has always been based on running Docker containers. Historically, use of Docker has been restricted to our “git push” model in which customers would push their code to Datica directly from their git repository and rely on our automated build process to build the code that would package that application for them.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><p>This buildpack architecture allowed Datica to control the build process from start-to-finish, ensuring security and compliance at every step of the application deployment process. But it didn’t always work great for our customers. For some customers, it’s not possible for them to deploy within that model. For example, they might not even have the code for the application they’re deploying to push to us. We’ve listened to our customers’ concerns about wanting a higher degree of control around creating and debugging their own applications and have come up with a secure solution where customers can now bring their own <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker images</a> onto the Datica Platform.</p> <h2 id=introducing-container-services>Introducing Container Services</h2> <p>Our just-released Container Services are an integral part of the Datica Platform and provide a direct way for customers to push a Docker image to Datica’s Docker registry, skipping the buildpack and “git push” process entirely. There are many benefits to this alternative deployment model, but the one we are most excited about is that our customers can push up an exact image to be run — without needing to rely on a build process, dependencies being available, or anything else of that nature.</p> <p><img src="https://images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6ctMlfnQYwoqgiOqYMceks/2f279eb149a585f621df28490a025a58/vertical_large.png?w=300" alt="Deploy Docker Images on Datica" class=float-right width=150 /></p> <p>Customers create their Dockerfile locally (built on top of Datica’s base image), sign it, and push it to Datica. Once that Docker image is pushed to the registry, a “deploy” command will run the image on the specified container service associated with their Datica environment.</p> <h2 id=security-and-compliance-built-in>Security and Compliance Built In</h2> <p>Giving customers that amount of control over their applications seems simple in theory, but the reality of adhering to HIPAA, GDPR, GxP and other healthcare regulations when developing digital health applications presented us with a massive security and compliance problem to solve before we could release this service to our customers.</p> <p>We have done an incredible amount of security work that is largely invisible to our customers so that this new feature can pass a difficult <a href="https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/">HITRUST certification audit</a>. For example, we have secured the containers with very stringent <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor">AppArmor profiles</a> and per-tenant namespace profiles in Linux so that it appears to customers that they can run privileged code (i.e. anything) on our system, when in fact we’ve limited them to a very thin slice of our resources. Additionally, we have created end-to-end security on receiving their Docker images by enforcing notarization of Docker images through the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/#what-is-notary">Docker notary service</a> which authenticates their images as being created by their organization so no one can push malicious code on their behalf.</p> <p>The notary service is especially useful in larger organizations, as it allows organizations to create “delegate” roles (via keys) within their organization so that, for example, they can ensure that only their operations team or CI can sign production images, but that the development team can sign staging or test images. See the notary documentation for more details on how to accomplish this.</p> <p>The ability for customers to construct Docker images locally, run them locally, and then push them onto The Datica Platform will increase developer productivity immensely and make it much easier for our customers to debug their own applications when something goes wrong with them. Our new Container Services also make deploying third-party vendor libraries (like Tableau or other licensed software) a whole lot easier.</p> <p><a href="/contact">Reach out to us</a> to learn more about bringing your Docker images onto the Datica Platform, or take a look at our guide to <a href="https://help.datica.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000128543">getting started with container services</a>.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <div class="group drop"> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--gray-dark"> <p class=blog-date>January 31, 2018</p> <h1 class=headline-2>Women in Cloud: New Support for Female Entrepreneurs</h1> </div> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--white"> <article class=content-dynamic> <div class=lead><p>Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing the male-dominated technology landscape.

Though women have made major strides forward on issues around equality, gender diversity in the workplace — especially at the top — remains an unattained goal.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <p>Women start out their careers just behind men in terms of everything from position to salary. As the chart below shows, that gap begins to widen as they’re up for their first promotion to manager, giving men an early head start in the race to leadership positions. They’re also less likely to be hired directly into leadership positions or to start their own businesses.</p> <p>Almost nowhere is this trend more prevalent than in the technology, and particularly cloud, industry. As a woman who began a very slow crawl up the corporate ladder at technology companies nearly thirty years ago, and who often finds herself as the only female leader around a table of men, I can personally attest to the absence of women in technology and leadership roles.</p> <p>Startups fail at the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#190f14636679">alarming rate of 90%</a> and most of them are coincidentally led by males. In fact, last year in the United States only 20% of businesses were owned by women, and women accounted for just 16% of executives.</p> <p><img src="//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6NN0Vp7GlUmqgm4EgAkGyC/f05ae0ef8fbbc8ce3718b1241bd5da51/Screen_Shot_2018-01-31_at_3.14.46_PM.png" alt="Gender representation in corporate pipeline 2016"/> <em>Source: Women in the Workplace 2016 study by leanin.org and McKinsey &amp; Company</em></p> <p>The funding statistics are even more alarming with less than 3% of VC funding going to female founders. Translating that into dollars, $58.2B in venture capital funds went to all-male founders and only $1.46B to female founders. At the same time, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">many studies</a> show that better business results are tied to greater diversity in the workplace and on the leadership team.</p> <blockquote> <p>Women-led businesses outperform comparable businesses led by male counterparts,” Jacqueline Touma, Founder/CEO Curious Enterprises</p> </blockquote> <p>These statistics and facts are alarming yet many companies and individuals are joining the effort to alter the male-dominated leadership dynamic at play. Companies’ commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, and new opportunities are emerging regularly to cultivate more females in STEM fields, leadership roles, and as company founders.</p> <h2 id=women-in-cloud-seattle>Women in Cloud Seattle</h2> <p>One of those notable new efforts was the inaugural <a href="http://www.womenincloud.com/">Women in Cloud</a> summit in Seattle, led by the Ignite WA leadership team in collaboration with industry partners, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Meylah. On a typical rainy Seattle January day, I had the pleasure of joining more than 350 technology leaders, predominantly women, at Microsoft’s Redmond campus for the event. We came together to celebrate the few female entrepreneurs in the tech world, discuss the issues that prevent women from becoming leaders and company founders, and to commit to offer a way forward through mentorship, community access, and funding.</p> <blockquote> <p>You cannot have a strong business if you do not have diverse perspective. This room has to go make that change,” Gretchen O’Hara, Vice President US OCP Microsoft</p> </blockquote> <p>A great lineup of speakers from the Washington technology and VC community spoke on topics ranging from the language of inclusion and the journey of women in tech, to accelerating women entrepreneurship in the cloud. Entrepreneurship was a common theme with two big announcements of projects to help female-funded startups.</p> <h2 id=women-in-cloud-accelerator-program>Women in Cloud Accelerator Program</h2> <p>Gavriella Schuster, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft shared information about a new initiative to help highly-motivated women who are founders of business-to-business cloud or technology companies. <a href="http://www.womenincloud.com/about/accelerator/">The Cloud Accelerator Lab</a> is an immersive 6-month program for female founders to start and build their businesses with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft distribution channels. Twenty to thirty selected participants team together and live together in Seattle to receive access to resources, mentorship, and funding to build their cloud businesses.</p> <blockquote> <p>My daughter’s outlook on the barriers in front of her is so different than mine were at her age—let’s make sure that keeps happening,” Gavriella Schuster, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=sybilla-masters-fund>Sybilla Masters Fund</h2> <p>Another highlight of the Women in Cloud summit was the announcement of the new Sybilla Masters Fund by Gillian Muessig, Co-Founder of MOZ and now CEO of <a href="http://outlinesventure.com/">Outlines Venture Group</a>. Sybilla Masters won a patent for her corn mill invention in 1720, becoming the first woman in the United States to receive a patent. It was awarded in her husband’s name because a woman wasn’t technically eligible, though he fought to make it known that Sybilla was the inventor. The new fund, named after Colonial America’s first female inventor, will officially launch when it reaches $2 million with an ultimate goal of raising $100 million.</p> <p>In Muessig’s own words as published in <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/moz-co-founder-gillian-muessig-unveils-new-venture-fund-back-women-led-startups/">an interview with GeekWire</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The object of the game here is to provide a fund that does gender-lensed investing, and that does not mean investing only in females or female founders. It really means looking at a company with the idea that says: How does this affect all genders, and in what way does it further the idea that all genders working together create a better outcome?”</p> </blockquote> <p>Microsoft veteran, Alka Badshah and Outlines Venture Group President Anne Kennedy are founding investors in the Sybilla Masters Fund and will also serve as advisors to Muessig, who is the general partner and manages the fund’s investments.  </p> <p>With this renewed effort and enthusiasm, I am hopeful we’ll finally see the trends reverse in the near future. And, as the statistics prove, women-owned businesses perform better so we may also see the startup failure rate decline as more female founders are funded and set up for success.</p> <p>Helping startups get from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises has always been part of the core of Datica’s DNA. We’re excited to share the news about these new initiatives with our own community of healthcare technology innovators in the hopes of seeing more female-led digital health businesses make it to market.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <div class="row section-article"> <div class="columns text-center"> <a href="#top" class="">Back to top <i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/public/js/svg-injector.js"></script> <script>
