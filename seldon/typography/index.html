The first was a speech by Alex Azar at the Federation of American Hospitals recent meeting about value-based care, and the second, given by Seema Verna at HIMSS18, emphasized the need for interoperability among EHRs. Together, these talks make it clear that the current administration wants to give consumers access to their health data. But, how will this happen?</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <h2 id=alex-azar-promotes-value-based-care-to-fah>Alex Azar promotes value-based care to FAH</h2> <p>The first, given by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to the Federation of American Hospitals on March 5, offered a four-point plan to move to a value-based care system faster. He noted that even taking recent advances in areas such as personalized medicine and cell therapies, the US healthcare system doesn’t deliver results to match costs.</p> <p>His four points included:</p> <ol> <li>Patients, rather than providers, should have ownership of health records.</li> <li>Costs should be transparent.</li> <li>Medicare and Medicaid will be used to drive change in the industry.</li> <li>Regulations that slow progress toward value-based care will be reduced.</li> </ol> <h2 id=seema-verma-announces-initiative-at-himss18>Seema Verma announces initiative at HIMSS18</h2> <p>The second, given the following day, March 6, by the current Administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), Seema Verma at Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society’s 2018 meeting (HIMSS18), emphasized the need for interoperability among electronic health record (EHR) systems.</p> <p>Verma announced a new initiative related to Azar’s first point. It is called the MyHealthEData initiative, and it is designed to give individuals access to their own health records. The announcement about MyHealthEData was published on the CMS website during Verma’s speech.</p> <p>“MyHealthEData will help twork to make clear that patients deserve to not only electronically receive a copy of their entire health record, but also be able to share their data with whomever they want, making the patient the center of the healthcare system,” read <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-items/2018-03-06.html">the announcement.</a></p> <h2 id=the-free-flow-of-information>The free flow of information</h2> <p>At least two factors are likely to inhibit the MyHealthEData initiative: the lack of interoperability among EHRs and the practice of data blocking. Verma addressed both in her HIMSS18 remarks.</p> <p>One way CMS plans to address the barriers to the free flow of information is by overhauling the Meaningful Use program. “Our new direction will not only reduce time and costs, but will also be laser focused on increased interoperability and giving patients access to their data across all of our programs,” <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/cms-shares-plans-to-enable-interoperability-value-based-care">Verma said in her speech.</a><br/> Additionally, data-blocking will be met with “a more aggressive stance” from CMS. “It is not acceptable to limit patient records or to prevent them and their doctor from seeing their complete history outside of a particular healthcare system,” Verma said.</p> <h2 id=what-does-it-all-mean>What does it all mean?</h2> <p>Taken together, these two speeches make it clear that the current administration wants to make sure consumers have access to their own healthcare records. However, that sentiment begs the question: What will consumers do with that information?</p> <p>“There is an entire level here involving not just data and information, but how the purchasers, payers, providers, and consumers of healthcare interact, and might interact going into the future – including with regard to sharing data and information among themselves to make business decisions affecting healthcare consumers,” says Mark Hagland of Healthcare Informatics in an <a href="https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/blogs/mark-hagland/payment/cms-makes-big-splash-verma-s-speech-what-does-it-really-mean?page=3">article analyzing the potential impact of the two speeches.</a></p> <p>Developers and programmers may play an important role in how consumers use their information. Apps that help patients understand and use their health data are likely to play a critical role, as are apps that help to transmit and streamline data.</p> <p>Verma said that patients will receive copies of their EHRs electronically, and that the process will happen through application programming interfaces, or APIs. “CMS believes the future of healthcare depends on the development of open APIs,” said Verma, adding that CMS will function as a convener of APIs across the digital system.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <div class="group drop"> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--gray-dark"> <p class=blog-date>March 15, 2018</p> <h1 class=headline-2>Payors Have Much to Gain from Advances in Technology</h1> </div> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--white"> <article class=content-dynamic> <div class=lead><p>Many healthcare networks, hospitals, and physicians’ offices know they need to make improvements in order to see the greatest gains from advances in technology, and according to a recent report by the credit rating agency AM Best, insurers are in the same boat.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <h2 id=areas-most-in-need-of-improvement>Areas Most in Need of Improvement</h2> <p>The report, titled, “Insurers — Behind the Technology Curve, and They Know It,” combines recommendations and results of a survey conducted by AM Best. According to the survey, <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/health-insurers-technology-upgrades-a-m-best">companies are focused on four primary areas</a> they consider to be most in need of technological improvement: customer experience; administrative and claim systems; data aggregation and mining; and underwriting/ new business systems.</p> <p>Only 3.5% of the respondents to the survey chose “risk management and compliance” as the area most in need of technological improvements. The majority, 33.3%, selected “customer experience” as the area most in need of tech improvements.</p> <p>One reason that so many insurers are behind the technological curve is the high pace of acquisitions in the recent past. Building integrated systems to handle claims, data aggregation, and underwriting is a challenge when a patchwork of legacy systems is in place.</p> <p>Upgrading those legacy systems will automatically strengthen cybersecurity, which could be one reason so many of the survey respondents chose customer experience, legacy systems, and data aggregation rather than risk management as the area most in need of tech improvements. Improvements in any one of the three categories is likely to also improve security.</p> <h2 id=legacy-systems-are-a-problem-throughout-healthcare>Legacy Systems Are a Problem Throughout Healthcare</h2> <p>The report specifically states that legacy systems “lack a high enough level of cybersecurity and can be compromised relatively easily, exacerbating operational risks,” according to an <a href="https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2018/02/21/175896.htm">article in Carrier Management</a>, confirming the idea that both upgrading legacy systems and improving the customer experience will lead to better security.</p> <p>Just as healthcare is looking toward the <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/">post-EHR world</a> of better interoperability, the payor side of the industry is also suffering from a lack of data accessibility. The report addresses the topic of legacy systems, saying, “Having a formal process to integrate data from an acquisition is imperative.” Many insurance companies simply rely on the knowledge of long-time employees.</p> <blockquote> <p>The next five to 10 years will be a critical period, during which organizations must learn to use that institutional knowledge to modernize their core systems and combine it with new technologies.”</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=partnerships-may-help-with-data-aggregation-and-mining>Partnerships May Help with Data Aggregation and Mining</h2> <p>Additionally, the information stored in disparate systems cannot be easily accessed, so insurers have a virtual treasure trove of information that they cannot mine. Advances in predictive modeling and machine learning could offer untapped business opportunities to insurers — as long as the data was both accessible and accurate.</p> <p>Working with insurtech companies could improve business for carriers that “already have rich troves of information about policyholders on pricing, retention, churn, uplift from analytics, policy-specific information and underwriting,” according to the report.</p> <p>The associate director of industry and analytics at AM Best, Jason Hopper, told Carrier Management,</p> <blockquote> <p>Insurtech companies will find deploying these capabilities difficult as they lack scale, while insurers may lack the depth about the power of computing and machine-learning techniques. Still, the combination of the two could be powerful and may lead to an inflection point that could change the typical insurance model.”</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=automation-could-follow-aggregation>Automation Could Follow Aggregation</h2> <p>Just as updating legacy systems would naturally improve cybersecurity, tapping into the potential of the data they have already gathered would help insurance companies automate their underwriting processes and improve pricing.</p> <p>The report suggests that taking advantage of tech must be part of the culture of an insurance company, and that the lead should come from the CEO’s office rather than the IT department. “They need to have an in-depth understanding of technological concepts and how they relate to specific business operations and strategy, given the potential for industry disruption,” Sridhar Manyem, director of industry research and analytics at AM Best <a href="http://www.citopbroker.com/news/insurers-working-to-catch-up-to-technology-curve-a-m-best-report-13843">told the publication Canadian Insurance Top Broker</a>.</p> <p>The report concludes with a warning:</p> <blockquote> <p>Companies that continue to evolve technologically will gain a substantial competitive advantage; competitors that don’t will suffer.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, the insurance industry has only to examine the evolution of technology in the healthcare industry to see how much new tech can improve operations, as well as how organizations that don’t invest are left behind.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <div class="row section-article"> <div class="columns text-center"> <a href="#top" class="">Back to top <i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/public/js/svg-injector.js"></script> <script>
