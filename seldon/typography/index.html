                                    <div class="lead"><p>The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information. The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html">HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool</a>.</p>

<p>Because entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However, a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent <a href="https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/">penalties of GDPR</a> coming in May of 2018.</p>
</div>
                                <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><h2 id="hipaa-security-is-still-a-problem">HIPAA Security is still a problem</h2>

<p>One thing is certain: healthcare <a href="https://datica.com/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/">still has a security problem</a>. The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches.</p>

<p><img src="//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg" alt="2017 Data Breaches by Type" /></p>

<p>One of the largest, which occurred at Airway Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and reported the breach to HHS in June.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier">a story about the Airway Oxygen breach</a> in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.</p>

<p>The story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking.</p>

<h2 id="many-types-of-entities-are-at-risk-not-only-healthcare-providers">Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers</h2>

<p>Another interesting thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies, and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches as well.</p>

<p>Late in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html">MongoDB databases fell victim to ransomware</a> attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice) that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special hacking tool.”</p>

<p>MongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software, but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September 2017, as many as 26,000 <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find">databases were hijacked and held for ransom</a>. Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in the attacks, along with other entities.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-others-mistakes">Lessons from others’ mistakes</h2>

<p>On December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI) was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals.</p>

<p>The FBI found that the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server. As many as 2.2 million people were affected.</p>

<p>The settlement was for 21CO to pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein &amp; Lehr LLP,
the results of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into <a href="https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement">what all healthcare entities should be doing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI); (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and, (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate without having written business associate agreement in place.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CAP that 21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements, among several other steps.</p>

<p>Saul Ewing Arnstein &amp; Lehr offer advice to other business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we begin 2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance and make timely adjustments as appropriate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we move through 2018 and toward May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not only with HIPAA, but also <a href="https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/">with GDPR</a>. After all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that amount in GDPR fines.</p>

<h2 id="the-us-health-system-is-like-a-casino">The U.S. health system is like a casino</h2>

<p>The US healthcare is like a casino because no one really knows the cost, the diagnosis, the outcome. Munroe says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is clinical evidence that many of the most expensive conditions to treat, ones like cancer, are the ones that are the result of totally random cell mutations. That happens about 66% of the time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there are other ways the healthcare system is a gamble, according to Munro. He notes that where you live matters almost more than your genetic code when it comes to your health in terms of quality of care and outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="universal-patient-identifiers-are-overdue-and-inevitable">Universal patient identifiers are overdue and inevitable</h2>

<p>Although social security numbers are not at all secure, the public fears the idea of a universal patient identifier. Munro believes that fear is based in ignorance of the risks of continuing to use social security numbers or name and birthdate combinations and that consumer education could help.</p>

<p>Munro says that about 10-14% of medical errors are the result of <a href="https://datica.com/blog/avoid-inaccurately-matching-patients-health-records/">mismatched patient identification</a> — a situation that could be remedied by adopting a system that included a universal patient identifier. The government mandates things such as vehicle identification numbers, AC power outlets, and the gauge of train tracks because there is a safety component to those things, and Munro suggests a similar safety issue exists in healthcare IT.</p>

<h3 id="patient-matching-is-especially-bad-in-light-of-the-need-for-interoperability">Patient matching is especially bad in light of the need for interoperability</h3>

<p>Within any given hospital system, patient matching is correct about 90% of the time. But, when patient data is shared outside a hospital system the accuracy rate drops to somewhere between 50 and 60%. It seems like there should be a correlation to when financial institutions adopted standards for ATMs.</p>

<p>“In fact,” says Munro, “the competing commercial interests are using the lack of interoperability to keep patients locked into their system.” Banks were losing customers by not having compatible ATMs; healthcare organizations are retaining them.</p>

<h3 id="hipaa-originally-mandated-the-creation-of-a-universal-patient-identifier">HIPAA originally mandated the creation of a universal patient identifier</h3>

<p>There are a couple of components of the original iteration of HIPAA that are often forgotten, according to Munro. <a href="https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA</a> requires portability of patient information, which in practicality requires a national patient identifier. He says HIPAA was “designed to create a national provider identifier and it was also tasked to create a national patient identifier.”</p>

<p>The national provider identifier part worked and is still in use today. “So we have a national provider identifier but for political and financial reasons, it was deemed to be too sensitive to create a national patient identifier,” says Munro.</p>

<h2 id="universal-coverage-and-single-pricing-would-work-better-in-healthcare-than-tiered-pricing">Universal coverage and single pricing would work better in healthcare than tiered pricing</h2>

<p>Munro wrote an article for Forbes titled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2017/07/04/single-payer-healthcare-isnt-necessary-but-single-pricing-is/#5415fd8ee0e3">“Single payer isn’t necessary but single pricing is.”</a> There are distinctions between single payer, single pricing, universal coverage. He says “We tend to lump the phrase in with medicare for all, single payer and universal healthcare. The reality is it is distinctly separate.”</p>

<p>Universal coverage is the correct phrase as opposed to universal healthcare. The World Health Organization defines that as being a situation in which, “All people have access to preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health services of sufficient quality to be effective while also ensuring that people do not suffer financial hardship when paying for these services.”</p>

<p>The debate is how that is paid for. He says universal coverage is the system being used in many other countries successfully and the one we need because it would move us from a system of tiered pricing to single pricing.</p>

<p>Currently, the US has a system of tiered coverage; it’s tiered for age, twice — once at the age of 26 and once again at 65 — as well as by military service, heritage, and income. Even with all that tiering, plus more within those tiers, there is still 10% of the population without coverage.</p>

<p>“The only reason that we do tiering in the sense of coverage is to support tiered pricing. The tiered pricing is really at the heart of a system that has been optimized for revenue and profits and not safety and quality,” says Munro.</p>

<h3 id="tiered-pricing-works-in-other-industries-but-that-doesnt-mean-it-works-for-healthcare">Tiered pricing works in other industries, but that doesn’t mean it works for healthcare.</h3>

<p>Munro describes how tiered pricing works in several other industries: if you purchase a mattress, you’ll find different prices at different retail outlets, when and where you purchase an airline ticket determines the price rather than your destination, and hotel rooms are priced differently by season or when events occur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So we have tiered pricing in every industry and the assumption has always been that that’s the way it should work and that’s the way it can work in healthcare. It really can’t.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="electronic-health-records-were-originally-billing-engines-but-things-have-changed">Electronic health records were originally billing engines, but things have changed</h2>

<p>Most people in the industry tend to think of EHRs as one big monolithic market with Epic at the top, but the reality is that small practices have different needs than the big health systems. Smaller organizations are more likely to choose a cloud-based application. The market is more diverse than many people think.</p>

<p>“EHRs were originally billing engines,” says Munro, “and we’ve tried to include clinical data.” He says that is another reason for the current interoperability problems in the industry.</p>

<h2 id="patient-access-leads-to-increased-risk">Patient access leads to increased risk</h2>

<p>There are issues with allowing patients access to their own data through patient portals. If a patient accesses their data from organization A then sends it to organization B, how can organization B know that the patient didn’t somehow corrupt the data and somehow increase their liability?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a desire to give patients access to their data and certainly some patients want more participation in the data process, but we still have to work through the elements of the risk associated to that data on whose part.”</p>
