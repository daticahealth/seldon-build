Some call it an outsized role with an outsized voice; but, the last 20 years have seen a significant decline in physician autonomy as payors have stepped in to more closely oversee and dictate, via reimbursements, how clinicians practice and provide care while more and more health system has employed physicians and taken them out of independent practices. These are just the trends. There are market forces creating and sustaining these trends.</p> <p>In this fourth part of our <a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/">2018 Healthcare Trends</a> series, I explore what we can expect to see as clinicians broaden their skillsets into digital health.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <p>One huge recent trend is the implementation of EHRs. Today, clinicians spend more time in the EHR than any other activity; this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675713004051">study</a> found ER doctors spent 44% of their time on data entry and only 28% on direct patient care. Doctors have been forced, again for various good and bad reasons, to document data in a certain way and a certain format. The EHR adoption of the last 15 years has been driven by non-clinical forces.</p> <p>Today, we see new trends in technology beyond the EHR. New digital health technology is being <a href="https://datica.com/blog/digital-health-apps-could-save-7-billion/">developed and adopted</a> for everything from clinical communications to telemedicine. With this increased technology fragmentation, as opposed to the <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/">monolithic EHR era</a>, we are in a time of letting 1,000 flowers bloom. And clinicians are taking the opportunity to influence, build, and deliver these new digital health solutions.</p> <h2 id=physicians-as-makers-of-digital-health-products>Physicians as makers of digital health products</h2> <p>Doctors, individually and as a group, are an interesting group. Painting with a very broad brush, doctors as a group are hard-working self-starters who believe they can do a lot of things well. They are also intimately knowledgeable about healthcare delivery, having spent thousands of hours in clinical settings in training and practice. Considering that, it’s not surprising to see more and more physicians designing and sometimes building digital health technologies.</p> <p>What’s fascinating is that this trend of clinicians as developers is in stark contrast in so many ways to the EHR proliferation era we are now exiting. While EHRs were developed to enable workflows, most clinicians conformed to the workflows of the EHR, not the other way around; EHRs can be customized to clinician workflows, but they rarely are in practice. Now, what we’re seeing is more and more clinicians developing technology to meet their own bespoke, or customized, workflows. That’s why it’s 1000s of blooming flowers of new clinician-designed and built digital health technologies.</p> <p>Yes, some clinicians are attempting to build sizeable digital health business meant to scale, but that’s not who I’m talking about in this post. I’m talking about clinicians, typically academic or independent practice, developing solutions for their day to day. There are often plans to commercialize and scale these bespoke solutions, but this is challenging because of the customized nature of the solutions.</p> <h2 id=risks-and-challenges-for-clinicians>Risks and Challenges for Clinicians</h2> <p>Despite the potential upside of digital health bringing efficiencies to clinician practices by automating or improving workflows, there are risks and challenges inherent to this approach, especially for health systems and academic medical centers. At Datica, we see this time and time again as health systems grapple to inventory all of the tools being built and used. This is the struggle of <a href="https://datica.com/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives/">shadow IT</a>.</p> <p>The reason this is happening is that clinicians have digital health technologies they want to build, or have already developed. They want to put these technologies to use in their practices. And, often, the traditional IT channels are too slow or don’t have the physician or human resources available. Today, more than ever before, there are no barriers to deploying and managing your own IT resources, so that is typically what clinicians do.</p> <p>As this becomes more widespread, and it’s already pretty common, we’re going to see more and more health systems develop strategies to enable clinicians as developers. The solution is likely not through traditional IT, at least unless traditional IT embraces cloud and new paradigms of technology delivery. What’s more likely is that formal innovation or digital strategies will develop that balance the needs of clinician developers with the needs of health systems to know what technologies are being used in their organization and where their patient data is flowing.</p> <p>I Invite you to also take a look at the first two trends we’ve already explored in this series: How <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/">cash-pay practices will grow in 2018</a> and my <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/">6 predictions for a post-EHR world.</a> And don’t forget to subscribe to the blog to the right to have the rest of the trends we’ll explore delivered right to your inbox.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <div class="group drop"> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--gray-dark"> <p class=blog-date>February 28, 2018</p> <h1 class=headline-2>The Good Guide to Surviving HIMSS 2018</h1> </div> <div class="container-pad--large container-color--white"> <article class=content-dynamic> <div class=lead><p>HIMSS is my most exhausting week of the year. I think this is my 9th HIMSS. Today, with 40,000+ attendees, it’s a logistical nightmare from start to finish. Everything from transportation to coffee is a challenge. Events go late into the night, and I always seem to have an early coffee or breakfast meeting, so sleep isn’t plentiful. I’m not sure if I prefer Las Vegas to Orlando as the location for HIMSS. Both have pros and cons.</p> <p>Below is my personal HIMSS survival guide. Hopefully, I can remember these things and keep my sanity next week.</p> </div> <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"> <h2 id=be-patient>Be patient</h2> <p>When you cram 40,000+ people into any location, even a behemoth Las Vegas hotel and conference center like the Venetian, the trains rarely run on time. Getting a car. Getting to a booth. Getting coffee. They all take way longer than you would expect. It can rattle you if you’re used to things running on a schedule. I’ll give HIMSS credit in that sessions usually do stick to their assigned time slots. It’s everything else that gets off the rails. The best advice is to relax and be patient. You’ll get that car or coffee eventually, and there’s precious little you can do to make it any better. Embrace the chaos and enjoy the spectacle of HIT’s annual Lollapalooza.</p> <h2 id=get-out-of-the-venetian>Get out of the Venetian</h2> <p>If you don’t have to be at the Venetian for an event at a set place (including booth time), go somewhere else. I’ve probably been to conferences at the Venetian 5-6 times, and it still confuses me how to get around. It’s vast so getting out is a commitment and likely something you’ll want to do at the start (breakfast) or end of the day. Getting out of the Venetian helps me to maintain my sanity and remember there is a real world out there where every conversation you hear isn’t about Epic or <a href="https://datica.com/guide/fhir/">FHIR</a> or population health. The one caveat to this is if you’re dead set on mingling and trying to network in the hopes that you hit it off with the anonymous person you meet at the Venetian</p> <h2 id=avoid-the-main-entrances>Avoid the main entrances</h2> <p>As I wrote above, the Venetian is large, and the bowels are confusing to navigate. If you can find a way to avoid the main ways in or out, you’ll find shorter coffee and drink lines. The worst times for the main arteries into the Venetian are, not surprisingly, around the conference schedules. Attendees tend to follow schedules, especially for exhibit hall opening times and keynotes. If you can, you’re better off going early or late to avoid the rush.</p> <h2 id=buffer-your-time>Buffer your time</h2> <p>I’d estimate less than 25% of my scheduled HIMSS meetings, not sessions, start on time. The exhibit hall is massive, so people always underestimate how long they need between meetings. The good part is, everybody at HIMSS knows that HIMSS is challenging so most people expect a certain portion of meetings to start late, get rescheduled, or to not start at all.</p> <h2 id=bring-a-battery-backup>Bring a battery backup</h2> <p>The bowels of the Venetian, deep in the exhibit hall and session rooms, have spotty mobile coverage. Couple that with the hordes of people sharing the mobile networks and your phone will eat a lot of battery establishing and re-establishing connections. Wall outlets are popular to combat this. Having a battery backup is super convenient if you want your phone to be on all day.</p> <h2 id=bring-good-shoes>Bring good shoes</h2> <p>I usually average 15-20k steps a day at HIMSS. I don’t attend many sessions, so I’m on feet pretty much all day. Comfortable shoes help make this a lot more pleasant.</p> <h2 id=take-notes>Take notes</h2> <p>I used to take notes religiously when I wrote for <a href="https://histalk2.com">HIStalk</a> because I’d write up daily summaries of the conference each night. As an aside, the people at HIStalk deserve a ton of credit for reporting on HIMSS; it’s a herculean task and makes me feel bad about my HIMSS whining in this post. I still write notes today, and if you see me next week, I’ll have my notebook with me. I take notes on people I meet and market intelligence related to Datica. There’s a lot to see and take in at HIMSS, too much for me to remember without notes.</p> <h2 id=get-some-swag>Get some swag</h2> <p>I usually try to get things for my kids and my wife to reduce my guilt from being away. One of my favorites was touchscreen gloves from <a href="https://www.imprivata.com">Imprivata</a>. I also try to get as many stuffed fish as I can from <a href="https://www.pilotfishtechnology.com">PilotFish</a>, though they’ve made it harder each year to get multiple fish. Every year there is new and exciting stuff to be had in the HIMSS exhibit hall. Not objective, but if you want the best swag in 2018, stop by the Datica booth (booth 5077) and check out our <a href="https://www.yeti.com">Yeti</a> cups.</p> <h2 id=balance-your-caffeine-intake>Balance your caffeine intake</h2> <p>HIMSS is like <a href="https://visual.ly/community/infographic/food/coffee-culture-seattle">coffee-obsessed Seattle</a> to me in that I always feel over-caffeinated by late morning or early afternoon. When this happens, especially if I’m not hydrating, I feel pretty crappy. My goal this year is to limit my caffeine intake for 2-3 cups a day, which isn’t too far off from my normal caffeine schedule. The Datica booth is going to be stocked with cold brew coffee for our team and those that stop by (booth 5077) so I’m hopeful my willpower overcomes the ease of caffeine access next week.</p> <h2 id=keep-smiling>Keep smiling</h2> <p>I have a lot of friends in HIT and enjoy running into people at HIMSS. It’s the one event each year where I get a chance to bump into specific people. As exhausting as the week is, it’s only really four days (M-Th) so smile and get through it.</p> <p>I hope to see you at HIMSS! Look for me at the Datica booth, #5077, or on Tuesday, March 6th at 11:00am in the Amazon Booth, #1625, for a talk I’m giving about HITRUST on AWS.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <div class="row section-article"> <div class="columns text-center"> <a href="#top" class="">Back to top <i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/public/js/svg-injector.js"></script> <script>
