<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/">3 Common Misconceptions about Business Associate Agreements</a>:</strong> 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate agreement.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/">2017 Healthcare Trends Part 1: The Rise of Patient as Consumer</a>:</strong> 
There’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before in a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and often wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently. Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and new problems.<br />

This 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs, raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs. In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.<br />

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/">Cloudflare, Data Breaches, and the HIPAA Conduit Exemption</a>:</strong> 
By now you’ve likely heard of the CloudFlare parser bug that caused CloudFlare’s CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event.</p>

<p>At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of? As it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/">SaaS, PaaS, IaaS—What’s the Difference?</a>:</strong> 
In a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital health, including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered was that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies are turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing complexities.</p>

<p>In 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought it a good time to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent in healthcare companies today.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/">The Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud</a>:</strong> 
I saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?” that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy.</p>

<p>The healthcare industry is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious. Even so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold, from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/">Announcing One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors</a>:</strong> 
Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.</p>

<p>We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing at scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/">5 Steps to HITRUST Certification</a>:</strong> 
“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis Good, Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica.</p>

<p>Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.

Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships, she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers. In our July, 2017 podcast</p>

<p>Dr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast.

The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT, but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately. Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense of it.</p>

                                <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><p>The changes in one year between 2017’s AWS re:Invent conference and this year’s edition were stark. We <a href="https://datica.com/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/">blogged</a> about <a href="https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/">some</a> of our <a href="https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/">observations</a>. In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo">got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions of “shadow IT” became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>It’s that dichotomy we’ve heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4’s report.</p>

<p>Readers will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view of health IT.</p>

<p>We scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts are saying.</p>

<p>As with the <a href="https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/">Spring report’s</a> op-ed from <a href="http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/">Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</a>, we were graced with <a href="http://sueschade.com/">Sue Schade’s</a> point of view in this report.</p>

<p>Few people have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career. Back in 2015, <a href="https://datica.com/innovation/sue-schade/">we interviewed Sue</a> for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a <a href="https://datica.com/podcast/">podcast</a> format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time. We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy. Thanks for reading!</p>
