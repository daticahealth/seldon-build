                                    <div class="lead"><p>It’s 2018, and the world looks much different <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/">than it did a year ago</a>. Go <a href="https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/">back even further</a> and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare increased unchecked, politicians took notice.</p>
</div>
                                <div class="section--body blog-post-content group">
<p>In our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like to impart change. <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/">President Trump is now working to alter</a> some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience), but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political position.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally, this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time, government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing the rules for how providers are paid.</p>

<p>Healthcare hasn’t improved for consumers. During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens, not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate our broken system.</p>

<p>Where does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government, individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move through the new year.</p>

<h2 id="subscription--direct-pay--cash-based-practices">Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices</h2>

<p>Consumers, with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It’s no wonder that subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance">emerging data sets</a> show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as well.</p>

<h2 id="post-ehr-healthcare">Post-EHR healthcare</h2>

<p>The gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over. The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs. Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this brave new world.</p>

<h2 id="clinicians-as-developers">Clinicians as developers</h2>

<p>The EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled services for their colleagues and their patients.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-cloud">The real cloud</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.himssconference.org/">HIMSS 2018</a>, the largest health technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-digital-health-hype">Beyond digital health hype</h2>

<p>Digital health has been hyped for a long time as a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public failures, like the recent <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million">acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion</a>, or the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/">Castlight Health initial public offering hype</a> and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking power.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-to-the-rescue">Blockchain to the rescue</h2>

<p>Speaking of hype, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe">blockchain has made its way into healthcare</a>. Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.</p>

<p>I’ll focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world; some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/">3 Common Misconceptions about Business Associate Agreements</a>:</strong> 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate agreement.

There’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before in a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and often wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently. Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and new problems.<br />

This 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs, raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs. In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.<br />

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/">Cloudflare, Data Breaches, and the HIPAA Conduit Exemption</a>:</strong> 
By now you’ve likely heard of the CloudFlare parser bug that caused CloudFlare’s CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event.</p>

<p>At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of? As it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.

I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at the 2nd HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. This topped my must-attend 2017 events list after I attended the first event last fall in Boston. Here’s what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/">SaaS, PaaS, IaaS—What’s the Difference?</a>:</strong> 
In a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital health, including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered was that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies are turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing complexities.</p>

<p>In 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought it a good time to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent in healthcare companies today.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/">The Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud</a>:</strong> 
I saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?” that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy.</p>

<p>The healthcare industry is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious. Even so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold, from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/">Announcing One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors</a>:</strong> 
Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.</p>

<p>We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing at scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/">5 Steps to HITRUST Certification</a>:</strong> 
“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis Good, Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica.</p>

<p>Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.

<p><strong><a href="https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/">Opportunities for Digital Health Vendors in the Pharmaceutical Industry</a>:</strong> 
Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships, she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers. In our July, 2017 podcast</p>

<p>Dr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast.
