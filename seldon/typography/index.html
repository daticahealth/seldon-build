                                    <div class="lead"><p>One of the biggest obstacles to using electronic health data to the fullest potential is the lack of interoperability. At every level of healthcare, the lack of interoperability causes problems: patients cannot easily access their own health data, providers have problems accessing the health information of new patients, researchers cannot access the data necessary to identify trends that would improve population health, and technology companies struggle to compete in a closed marketplace.</p>
</div>
                                <div class="section--body blog-post-content group"><p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text">21st Century Cures Act</a>, sometimes referred to as the Cures Act, which was passed in December 2016, identifies the need for interoperability. Interoperability would make the exchange of personal health information (PHI) possible while still maintaining security. Currently, information is siloed within EHR systems, and <a href="https://datica.com/platform/integration/">data integration with those EHRs</a> is frequently cited issue for healthcare providers.</p>

<p>Alongside the need for various stakeholders to be able to access information, there is the requirement to follow the dictates of the <a href="https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a>. Information needs to be accessible, but must also remain secure. Through the Cures Act, Congress instructed the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to create or support the creation of a framework for health information networks (HINs) to exchange health information through a common agreement.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-trusted-exchange-framework">What is The Trusted Exchange Framework?</h2>

<p>The draft Trusted Exchange Framework is the first step toward interoperability. The ONC has published a <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-guide.pdf">User’s Guide to Understanding the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework</a>. The document was released on January 5, 2018, and consists of two parts:</p>

<p>Part A - Principles for Trusted Exchange
Part B - Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange</p>

<p>Stakeholders are <a href="https://beta.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement">encouraged to submit comments</a> through February 20, 2018. Once comments have been submitted and a final version agreed upon, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) will be published in the Federal Register. The ONC expects the final version to be published by late 2018.</p>

<p>The stakeholders include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health information networks</li>
  <li>Federal agencies</li>
  <li>Public health organizations</li>
  <li>Individuals</li>
  <li>Payers</li>
  <li>Providers</li>
  <li>Technology developers</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important goals of the Trusted Exchange Framework is to create what the ONC describes as “a single on-ramp” to interoperability. Currently, healthcare organizations use different point-to-point interfaces to exchange PHI with each other. This system requires the creation and maintenance of all those individual interfaces, which is expensive and inefficient.</p>

<p>Creating one framework for various stakeholders to exchange information will simplify the process, make accessing their own PHI easier for patients, and create a more competitive market for technology companies.</p>

<h2 id="two-parts-of-the-trusted-exchange-framework">Two Parts of the Trusted Exchange Framework</h2>

<h3 id="trusted-exchange-framework-part-a">Trusted Exchange Framework Part A</h3>

<p>The first part of the Framework is Principles for Trusted Exchange. The ONC has defined six principles: 
1. Standardization
2. Transparency
3. Cooperation and Non-Discrimination
4. Security and Patient Safety
5. Access
6. Data-Driven Accountability</p>

<p>These general principles are described as “guardrails,” and the goal of Part A is to build trust among the various HINs.</p>

<h3 id="trusted-exchange-framework-part-b">Trusted Exchange Framework Part B</h3>

<p>The second part of the framework is Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. This section creates common practices for the exchange of health information, including a common authentication process, rules for exchange, and organizational and operational practices.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/onc-genevieve-morris-trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-interoperability">Fierce Healthcare</a>, Genevieve Morris, the principal deputy national coordinator for health information technology at the ONC said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is just the floor of what those required terms and conditions are. We all just have to agree to the same terms in order for that exchange to happen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="building-on-the-3-goals-of-interoperability">Building on the 3 Goals of Interoperability</h2>

<p>The Trusted Exchange Framework builds on the work that the industry has already done to advance interoperability. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/01/05/draft-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-released-hhs.html">A press release</a> from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the draft stresses that there are three important goals of interoperability:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Patient access - patients should be able to easily access their own health information.</li>
  <li>Population-level data exchange - both providers and payers need access to population-level health data in order to analyze trends, outcomes, and costs.</li>
  <li>Open and accessible APIs - giving the health IT community access to health information will improve the entrepreneurial climate, leading to innovation and improved usability.</li>
</ol>

<p>The ONC will outsource the actual implementation of the framework. The ONC will hold an “open and competitive selection of a single Recognized Exchange Framework Entity (RCE) from the industry,” wrote Morris in a <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-common-sense-approach-achieving-health-information-interoperability/">blog post on HealthIT Buzz</a>.</p>

<p>The RCE will work with the ONC to develop the final version of the TEFCA that is published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p>In our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like to impart change. <a href="https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/">President Trump is now working to alter</a> some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience), but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political position.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally, this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time, government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing the rules for how providers are paid.</p>

<p>Healthcare hasn’t improved for consumers. During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens, not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate our broken system.</p>

<p>Where does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government, individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move through the new year.</p>

<h2 id="subscription--direct-pay--cash-based-practices">Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices</h2>

<p>Consumers, with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It’s no wonder that subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance">emerging data sets</a> show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as well.</p>

<h2 id="post-ehr-healthcare">Post-EHR healthcare</h2>

<p>The gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over. The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs. Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this brave new world.</p>

<h2 id="clinicians-as-developers">Clinicians as developers</h2>

<p>The EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled services for their colleagues and their patients.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-cloud">The real cloud</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.himssconference.org/">HIMSS 2018</a>, the largest health technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-digital-health-hype">Beyond digital health hype</h2>

<p>Digital health has been hyped for a long time as a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public failures, like the recent <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million">acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion</a>, or the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/">Castlight Health initial public offering hype</a> and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking power.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-to-the-rescue">Blockchain to the rescue</h2>

<p>Speaking of hype, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe">blockchain has made its way into healthcare</a>. Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.</p>

<p>I’ll focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world; some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.</p>
