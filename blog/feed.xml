    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do is to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier for developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/dhsf/"&gt;Digital Health Success Framework&lt;/a&gt; — a living document that provides a guide through the journey of developing a HIPAA compliant application for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we are continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This November, the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/podcast/"&gt;Healthcare Innovators Podcast&lt;/a&gt; interviewed a very special industry guest. Due to audio difficulties, we chose to run a transcript of our fascinating conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther Dyson has worn many different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author, businesswoman, commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup cosmonaut. Esther sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In this interview, she shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital health success, the importance of security and privacy for digital health firms, and gave us an update on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American communities to use different measures to cultivate health and invest in the value wellness returns.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;$360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own. That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost of developing the technology for their own application. We often hear early-stage developers say they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using AWS. That’s when the steep education process begins to help them understand they’re just at the beginning of the compliance journey with AWS and there’s so much more to consider to build a compliant application in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="why-is-encryption-important"&gt;Why is encryption important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIPAA compliance has requirements for the transfer and storage of &lt;a href="https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/"&gt;Protected Health Information (PHI)&lt;/a&gt;. Standard SSH file transfer can securely transfer data onto the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/platform/"&gt;Datica Platform&lt;/a&gt;. However, the files need to be encrypted at rest on the SSH sender’s storage volume before being doubly encrypted/decrypted during the SSH transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can manage part of your encryption for transfer yourself, you still need to have a method for encrypting storage volumes, containers, and the data transferred between those services. Datica’s platform meets those requirements for everything, once the data makes it onto the platform (HITRUST-audited policy 17.9).&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito” kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, we published our first industry report titled &lt;a href="https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/"&gt;The Heart of Medicine: Transformation Through Technology&lt;/a&gt;. The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around the topic of “cloud” within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress of digital health.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we get our booth shipped and bags packed for Health 2.0 this year, I started thinking about when I first attended Health 2.0 five years ago. It was held at the Hilton in Union Square in San Francisco. I was in town for my startup’s interview at Rock Health, which at the time was just a stroll down Geary and a left on Grant through the &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Dragon_Gate_to_Chinatown.jpg"&gt;Dragon Gate&lt;/a&gt; to the Rock Health offices in Chinatown. It was my first day ever in San Francisco; a place I would soon call home as I spent a chunk of 2012-2013 in the city for Rock Health.&lt;/p&gt;
