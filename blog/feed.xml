    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Day 3 of AWS re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing AWS Fargate among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we’re excited about Fargate?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/"&gt;new AWS services&lt;/a&gt;. One such service that has us excited is &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/"&gt;AWS Fargate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was able to attend several healthcare track sessions yesterday (&lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/" title="Datica's AWS presentation"&gt;including Datica’s&lt;/a&gt;) and the future looks bright. Healthcare is poised to fully embrace the cloud in 2018. The sentiment in the market has changed and it truly feels like we’re on the edge of a major shift in the approach healthcare organizations are taking when building and hosting their software.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare’s regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he’s charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the “Ticket Hell” he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about healthcare today? As the third in our &lt;a href="/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/"&gt;Mapping Digital Health&lt;/a&gt; series of interviews, we asked &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com/john-moore"&gt;Dr. John Moore&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Founder of Twine Health, about the status of patient engagement in healthcare. Moore’s entrepreneurial career had an unusual start when, as an undergrad at Boston University, he founded a breakdancing club. As he completed medical school and trained to become a specialized eye surgeon, he recognized a major break in communication between patients and their doctors once they left their doctor’s offices. Moore founded &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com"&gt;Twine Health&lt;/a&gt; in order to create technology that really reaches patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do is to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier for developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/dhsf/"&gt;Digital Health Success Framework&lt;/a&gt; — a living document that provides a guide through the journey of developing a HIPAA compliant application for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we are continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
