    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this 3rd part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series, Travis Good MD, CEO of Datica, offers a deep look at what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and, by extension, patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this third part of our &lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/"&gt;2018 Healthcare Trends&lt;/a&gt; series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;New! Customers deploy custom Docker images onto Datica to increase their productivity and make it much easier to debug their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly impossible to be a part of a conversation among application or cloud developers today without somebody mentioning Docker or containers. Datica was an early adopter of Docker containers and, in fact, the Datica Platform has always been based on running Docker containers. Historically, use of Docker has been restricted to our “git push” model in which customers would push their code to Datica directly from their git repository and rely on our automated build process to build the code that would package that application for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing the male-dominated technology landscape. Just last week in Stockholm, the &lt;a href="https://www.womenintech.se/"&gt;Women in Tech 2018&lt;/a&gt; conference sold out completely in just two minutes after tickets went on sale. It seems that you can’t read today’s news without finding another story about women speaking out about gender injustices. Though women have made major strides forward on issues around equality, gender diversity in the workplace — especially at the top — remains an unattained goal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where is healthcare going in 2018? In the first article in this series, I outlined &lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/"&gt;six trends for 2018&lt;/a&gt; I predict we’ll see as the government, individuals, and private sector demand change this year. The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay practices. Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: healthcare still has a security problem. Out of 295 breaches reported so far for 2017, 132 are hacking/IT incident breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information. The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html"&gt;HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However, a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent &lt;a href="https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/"&gt;penalties of GDPR&lt;/a&gt; coming in May of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
