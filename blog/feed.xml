    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This holiday season, we’re proud to support one of our favorite open source projects, Let’s Encrypt, in their mission to make the internet more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We highly value open-source technology at Datica. We’re not only contributors to the open source community, but &lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/"&gt;open source users&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://datica.com/open-source/"&gt;producers&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such open source project that we’re absolutely thrilled to be using is &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/em&gt; is a completely free and open source certificate authority. Developers can use &lt;em&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/em&gt; to obtain a free SSL/TLS certificate for their websites and applications. This allows them to enable a secure connection for their users via HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union back to the states, you must address an additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. The &lt;a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"&gt;EU-U.S. Privacy Shield&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment. This &lt;a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1"&gt;self-certification&lt;/a&gt; or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare’s regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he’s charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the “Ticket Hell” he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about healthcare today? As the third in our &lt;a href="/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/"&gt;Mapping Digital Health&lt;/a&gt; series of interviews, we asked &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com/john-moore"&gt;Dr. John Moore&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Founder of Twine Health, about the status of patient engagement in healthcare. Moore’s entrepreneurial career had an unusual start when, as an undergrad at Boston University, he founded a breakdancing club. As he completed medical school and trained to become a specialized eye surgeon, he recognized a major break in communication between patients and their doctors once they left their doctor’s offices. Moore founded &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com"&gt;Twine Health&lt;/a&gt; in order to create technology that really reaches patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do is to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier for developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/dhsf/"&gt;Digital Health Success Framework&lt;/a&gt; — a living document that provides a guide through the journey of developing a HIPAA compliant application for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we are continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
