    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare’s regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he’s charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the “Ticket Hell” he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about healthcare today? As the third in our &lt;a href="/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/"&gt;Mapping Digital Health&lt;/a&gt; series of interviews, we asked &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com/john-moore"&gt;Dr. John Moore&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Founder of Twine Health, about the status of patient engagement in healthcare. Moore’s entrepreneurial career had an unusual start when, as an undergrad at Boston University, he founded a breakdancing club. As he completed medical school and trained to become a specialized eye surgeon, he recognized a major break in communication between patients and their doctors once they left their doctor’s offices. Moore founded &lt;a href="https://www.twinehealth.com"&gt;Twine Health&lt;/a&gt; in order to create technology that really reaches patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do is to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier for developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/dhsf/"&gt;Digital Health Success Framework&lt;/a&gt; — a living document that provides a guide through the journey of developing a HIPAA compliant application for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we are continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther Dyson has worn many different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author, businesswoman, commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup cosmonaut. Esther sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In this interview, she shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital health success, the importance of security and privacy for digital health firms, and gave us an update on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American communities to use different measures to cultivate health and invest in the value wellness returns.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;$360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own. That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost of developing the technology for their own application. We often hear early-stage developers say they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using AWS. That’s when the steep education process begins to help them understand they’re just at the beginning of the compliance journey with AWS and there’s so much more to consider to build a compliant application in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The GnuPG is a free implementation of OpenPGP — the most widely used email encryption standard. Learn how to use GnuPG and OpenPG to automatically decrypt encrypted SFTP files.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="why-is-encryption-important"&gt;Why is encryption important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIPAA compliance has requirements for the transfer and storage of &lt;a href="https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/"&gt;Protected Health Information (PHI)&lt;/a&gt;. Standard SSH file transfer can securely transfer data onto the &lt;a href="https://datica.com/platform/"&gt;Datica Platform&lt;/a&gt;. However, the files need to be encrypted at rest on the SSH sender’s storage volume before being doubly encrypted/decrypted during the SSH transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can manage part of your encryption for transfer yourself, you still need to have a method for encrypting storage volumes, containers, and the data transferred between those services. Datica’s platform meets those requirements for everything, once the data makes it onto the platform (HITRUST-audited policy 17.9).&lt;/p&gt;
