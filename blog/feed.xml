    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The “real cloud” in healthcare is not virtualization. We are talking about the public cloud and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Information technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/electronic-health-records-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html"&gt;colossal chunk&lt;/a&gt; of their time supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors, health system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to EHRs, hospital IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies, that require care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications and you quickly see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a significant strategic priority for healthcare organizations is assessing the cloud, developing a cloud strategy, and implementing that strategy. Most organizations are at some stage in this process. Many are still pre-implementation of a cloud strategy. But, it’s coming. And the health IT backlog is not conducive to the massive amount of work required to start moving technology to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clinicians, in particular physicians, have always played a significant role in healthcare. Some call it an outsized role with an outsized voice; but, the last 20 years have seen a significant decline in physician autonomy as payors have stepped in to more closely oversee and dictate, via reimbursements, how clinicians practice and provide care while more and more health system has employed physicians and taken them out of independent practices. These are just the trends. There are market forces creating and sustaining these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this fourth part of our &lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/"&gt;2018 Healthcare Trends&lt;/a&gt; series, I explore what we can expect to see as clinicians broaden their skillsets into digital health.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HIMSS is my most exhausting week of the year. I think this is my 9th HIMSS. Today, with 40,000+ attendees, it’s a logistical nightmare from start to finish. Everything from transportation to coffee is a challenge. Events go late into the night, and I always seem to have an early coffee or breakfast meeting, so sleep isn’t plentiful. I’m not sure if I prefer Las Vegas to Orlando as the location for HIMSS. Both have pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my personal HIMSS survival guide. Hopefully, I can remember these things and keep my sanity next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and, by extension, patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this third part of our &lt;a href="https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/"&gt;2018 Healthcare Trends&lt;/a&gt; series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world.&lt;/p&gt;
