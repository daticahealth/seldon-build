                            <p>With all the buzzwords in the healthcare industry, it has become impossible to keep track of their many interpretations and evolutions, but more importantly, tracking how to properly enable solutions. Previously, physicians handled the clinical affairs while healthcare administrators managed the finances and operations. Presently, those roles have blurred. With such close working environments, some baselines must be met to fully enable the acceleration of clinical integration.</p>

                            <p>Healthcare is completely different from any other industry so is it possible to take everyday shortcuts to achieve the desired entrepreneurial results? If you ask one of the latest  Silicon Valley sweethearts, Zenefits, as of late, the answer is an astounding no. As Zenefits’ COO David Sacks states, “Compliance is like oxygen. Without it, we die.” With the immediate resignation of Parker Conrad, former Zenefits’ CEO, we will see if Zenefits’ will be given the kiss of life as compliance becomes a newly adopted core pillar to the organization.</p>

                            <p>Prediction posts are fun, despite my relatively low batting average for success. The hardest part about making predictions in healthcare is timing. And timing can be everything. Lots of predictions, like we’ll see X% risk-based or value-based care contracts, are hard to deny but quantifying them in terms of when these changes will tip in the industry is the challenge. With that disclaimer, below are my predictions for healthcare in 2016, with a bend towards healthcare technology.</p>

Most innovation stems from academia, allowing data scientists, economists and medical professionals to collaborate more openly than in contrast to a corporate setting, but fresh ideas come from private sectors of healthcare as well. As workflow pressures increase, healthcare system executives are faced with a challenging decision of continuing to focus on regulatory burdens, security threats, and changing reimbursement models or to allocate the time and resources necessary for effective innovation amongst the myriad of mandated organizational projects.</p>

A few macro level initiatives of innovation include being able to scale the business by creating constant opportunity, shifting from a fee-for-service model, managing cost of care, and providing a framework needed to support the operational and legal backends. These innovative measures face many challenges though. The core two being: 1) Managing the total cost of care budgets by managing risk contracts and delivering the right care at the right time; and 2) Improving quality while effectively earning revenue.</p>

                            <p>One of the major problems with patient engagement is that it’s a buzzword. Like most buzzwords, it is often used without much thought going in to what it really means. I admit to being part of the problem. I’ve written about patient engagement without providing a real definition for it. I think I know what I mean by patient engagement, but my definition tends to be use case driven, meaning I have something very specific applications of engagement in mind when I write about it.</p>

                            <p>The most critical issue the healthcare industry is seeing when it comes to patient engagement is altering the perspectives and suppositions of patients and clinicians. Many believe that patient portals are the end-all solution for patient engagement by simply satisfying Meaningful Use requirements, but what many fail to understand is that patient engagement is not simply technological advancements; it is a complete culture change.</p>

                            <p>It’s true: 2015 is beginning to show that hospitals are stemming their primary initiatives from patient engagement. When the HITECH Act was passed back in 2009, hospitals and all medical facilities started to create patient portals to assure that patients would be able to view, download, and even transmit their medical profiles and information as they see fit. But as the latest findings will report, not only are patient engagement stratagem taking priority, but data security is at the forefront as well, closing the loop on the rising number of patient data breaches and cybersecurity attacks that threaten the healthcare industry to ensure value-based healthcare delivery is successful.</p>
